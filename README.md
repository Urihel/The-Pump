# The-Pump
Is a project web app im building to be used with an algorithm that is able to find you the cheapest and most closes pump or elctric charge station to your finger tips. While its still a project i hope to intergrate things to the app like operations hrs to pump stations, whether there as built restaurants or food marktets in them, whether car washses are present or other services are present that consumers are not aware about and an AI that is able to read fuel data in car and determine the smartest option and closes option when low on fuel. All in the works but having fun building this app.
