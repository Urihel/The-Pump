# The-Pump
Is a project web app im building to be used with an algorithm that is able to find you the cheapest and most closest pump or elctric charge station to your finger tips. While its still a project i hope to intergrate things to the app like operations hrs to pump stations, whether restaurants or food marktets exist in them, whether car washses are present or other services are present that consumers are not aware about and an AI that is able to read MPG data when your fuel or charge is low and immediately searches and routes you to nearest open station.
